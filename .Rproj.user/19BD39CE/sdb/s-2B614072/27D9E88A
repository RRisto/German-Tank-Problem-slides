All tanks have sequential serial number. Problems name originates from WWII when allies really had this problem.\n\n- For example you have captured 5 tanks with serial numbers 73, 5, 83, 49, 25\n\n- What is real tank production?\n\n- How would you solve this problem?\n\n\n\n--- .class #id\n\n<style>\nstrong {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n\n## Simulator\n\nShiny app for comparing different solutions: https://ristohinno.shinyapps.io/GermanTankProblem/\n\n- **Model 1**, takes the highest serial number captured and say it is total tank production\n\n- **Model 2**, takes model 1 solution and add and add a margin to it (because first model tends to understimate actual tank production)\n\n- **Model 3**, uses formula originally used by allies (at least one of them): $$max + \\frac{max}{n} - 1$$ \nwhere: \n\n1. max is maximum serial number captured, \n\n2. n is number of tanks captured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
